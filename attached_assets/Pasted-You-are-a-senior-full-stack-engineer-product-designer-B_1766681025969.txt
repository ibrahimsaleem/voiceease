You are a senior full-stack engineer + product designer. Build a production-ready web app for a voice AI automation company called VoiceEase.

GOAL
Create a high-converting, futuristic agency website + a lightweight customer portal:
- Marketing site (public pages) to generate demos/leads
- Auth (signup/login)
- Customer dashboard where users fill a business intake form
- AI recommendation page that suggests Starter ($500) vs Custom ($1000)
- Submit “Agent Request” which creates a lead for the VoiceEase team to follow up and close

STACK (use exactly this)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Prisma ORM + SQLite (local Replit DB)
- NextAuth (Credentials provider) for email+password auth
- Zod for validation
- Server Actions for form submits
- No paid APIs required

DESIGN SYSTEM
Futuristic, premium, clean. Use:
- Primary: Purple (#6D28D9 or similar)
- Background: White + light grey (#F3F4F6)
- Text: Dark grey (#111827)
- Subtle glass/gradient accents, soft shadows, rounded 2xl
- Smooth micro-animations (CSS transitions only)
- Mobile-first layout and accessible typography

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (PUBLIC)
Create these pages with polished copy:
1) /
2) /how-it-works
3) /solutions (by industry)
4) /features
5) /pricing
6) /use-cases
7) /demo (book a call)
8) /about
9) /contact
10) /login
11) /signup

AUTHENTICATED (PORTAL)
12) /app (dashboard home)
13) /app/request-agent (business intake form)
14) /app/recommendation (AI suggests best plan + sample call flow preview)
15) /app/requests (list of submitted requests)
16) /app/settings (profile + logout)

PRICING REQUIREMENTS
- Starter Agent: $500 one-time setup
  Includes: 24/7 answering, FAQ, booking, lead capture, calendar integration, SMS/email confirmations, basic analytics/transcripts, industry templates.
- Custom-Trained Agent: $1000 one-time setup
  Includes everything + custom scripts/training, custom qualification logic, routing rules, advanced booking logic, optional CRM integration.
- Put these clearly on /pricing and in recommendation output.

PORTAL FLOW REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
1) User signs up with email+password.
2) User logs in -> /app
3) User clicks “Request Your AI Voice Agent” -> /app/request-agent
4) Intake form fields:
   - businessName (required)
   - industry (dropdown: salons/spas, cafes/restaurants, dentists, doctors/clinics, lawyers, resorts/hotels, realtors, creators/coaches, gyms, local services)
   - businessPhone (required)
   - businessHours
   - servicesOffered (textarea)
   - appointmentTypes (multi-select or comma input)
   - calendarUsed (Google, Outlook, None)
   - typicalQuestions (textarea)
   - primaryGoal (increase bookings, capture leads, customer support, after-hours coverage, all)
   - preferredLanguage (English default + optional)
5) On submit:
   - Validate with Zod
   - Save to DB as an AgentRequest with status = "NEW"
   - Generate an “AI Recommendation” WITHOUT external LLM: implement a deterministic rules engine based on form inputs:
       - If industry is dentist/doctor/lawyer/resort OR servicesOffered length > 200 OR appointmentTypes includes multiple types OR calendarUsed is not None -> suggest Custom ($1000)
       - Else suggest Starter ($500)
     Also generate:
       - recommendedCallFlows: list of 3-5 bullet flows
       - sampleOpeningScript: 3-5 lines
       - expectedImpact: conservative copy like “reduce missed calls and increase booked appointments”
6) Show recommendation page with:
   - Plan card (Starter or Custom)
   - Features included
   - Preview script + call flow bullets
   - CTA: “Request This Agent”
7) “Request This Agent” finalizes the request:
   - Update DB: planSelected, status = "REQUESTED"
   - Show success page: “We’ll contact you within 1 business day” (static text)
   - Add /app/requests list so user can see submitted requests

DATABASE (PRISMA)
Create Prisma schema with:
- User: id, email (unique), passwordHash, createdAt
- AgentRequest: id, userId (FK), businessName, industry, businessPhone, businessHours, servicesOffered, appointmentTypes, calendarUsed, typicalQuestions, primaryGoal, preferredLanguage, recommendationPlan, recommendationData (JSON), planSelected, status (NEW|RECOMMENDED|REQUESTED), createdAt, updatedAt

SECURITY
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Protect /app routes with NextAuth session checks
- Server actions must verify session userId
- Basic rate limit: simple in-memory per IP for signup/login (good enough for demo)

MARKETING SITE COPY (HIGH CONVERSION)
Use this positioning:
- Company: VoiceEase
- Tagline: “Never Miss a Call. Never Miss a Lead.”
- Problem: missed calls = lost revenue; after-hours lost forever
- Solution: 24/7 natural voice AI receptionist that books appointments, qualifies leads, answers FAQs, routes calls, sends SMS/email confirmations.
- Industries: salons, restaurants, dentists, clinics, lawyers, resorts, realtors, creators, gyms, local services.
Include:
- Hero headline + subheadline + 2 CTAs (Primary: Book a Free Demo, Secondary: See How It Works)
- Social proof placeholders
- Benefit blocks (Revenue recovery, Time saved, Always-on, Consistent experience)
- How it works steps (4)
- Feature grid
- Use-case snippets per industry
- Pricing section summary with $500/$1000
- FAQ
- Strong final CTA section

PAGES DETAILS
/solutions: show industry cards with pain point + how VoiceEase helps + 2-3 example call tasks.
/demo: embed a simple “Book a call” form (name, email, business, phone, message) that saves to DB as DemoLead (add model) OR just stores in AgentRequest? Prefer a separate DemoLead model.
/contact: contact form (name, email, message) saved to DB as ContactMessage.

EXTRA REQUIREMENTS
- Add top nav with Login/Signup; when logged in show “Dashboard”
- Add footer with links + privacy/terms placeholders
- Add a “live demo” style component on homepage: a fake phone call transcript UI with typing animation (no external libs required)
- Add responsive styling and clean component structure

OUTPUT
- Provide the full Replit project with instructions in README:
  - npm install
  - npx prisma migrate dev
  - npm run dev
- Ensure it runs end-to-end in Replit with SQLite.
- Include seed script to create a demo user and example requests.

Now generate the entire codebase with correct folder structure, components, pages, Prisma schema, and styling. Ensure there are no missing imports and the app compiles.
